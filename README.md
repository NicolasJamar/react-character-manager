# React Character Manager

A simple web interface in React to use [this API](https://character-database.becode.xyz/) for adding, editing et deleting character in it.

Create a character manger with:

* List of Character
* Displaying an image
* A long description
* Possibility to create a new character
* Possibility to edit an image
* Possibility to delete a Character
